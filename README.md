## Data 
App fetches data from the [SpaceX api](https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches?launch_year=2018) and displays in a user-friendly way.
User can change time period for the viewed flights. Also clicking on the flights in the list, user will
be redirected to the article about selected flight.
## Architecture
Model View Presenter. I tried to adhere to the structure. Every action is set in the interfaces.
## Kotlin
It's been a month since I've started using Kotlin. Now it's pretty comfortable to use it, but still have to practice way more, and start 
making use of Kotlin features.
## Libraries
No libraries were used, as it was stated in the task. Fetching network data using AsyncTasks.
